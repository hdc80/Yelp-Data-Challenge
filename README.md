# Yelp-Data-Challenge

## Abstract
This project aims to recommend business to users and to predict  number of reviews a business will receive in the future. The recommendation algorithm uses the review data to improve the recommendations. We also evaluate the performance of multiple recommendation algorithms.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to solve two interesting problems using the Yelp Data. Yelp is the one of most popular websites where users check for reviews before visiting a particular business. But Yelp does not provide recommendations at this point of time. Users have to go through the reviews of each business and decide whether to visit a particular business. The two questions that we attempt to tackle in this project are as follows:

    . item Recommend business to users
    . item Predict the number of reviews for a business
